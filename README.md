# Tic Tac Toe Game

This is a simple Tic Tac Toe game implemented in Python using the Tkinter library for the graphical user interface.

## Description

This program allows two players to play the classic game of Tic Tac Toe. The game board consists of a 3x3 grid where players take turns marking their symbol ('X' or 'O') in empty squares. The first player to align three of their symbols in a row, column, or diagonal wins the game. If all squares are filled and no player has won, the game ends in a draw.

The game features:
- Graphical user interface using Tkinter.
- Buttons representing each cell in the Tic Tac Toe grid.
- Players alternate turns automatically.
- Win detection to determine the winner or declare a draw.
- Once a button is clicked, it cannot be clicked again.

## How to Play

1. Run the Python script.
2. The game window will open with a 3x3 grid of buttons.
3. Players take turns clicking on the buttons to place their symbol ('X' or 'O').
4. The game automatically detects wins or draws and displays the result.
5. To start a new game, close the current window and run the script again.
